		Cummins to Shankar, out Caught by Shubman Gill!! Just what the doctor ordered for KKR. Short, skiddy and Shankar shapes for the pull from the crease. Loses his shape totally and a top edge follows which descends and lands into the safe hands of Gill at backward point, who had to move to his left and collect it. Shankar c Shubman Gill b Cummins 7(10) <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_fonts.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_fonts.asp</a>

	<p class="style">Cummins to Abdul Samad, SIX, woah! Where did this come from all of a sudden? Samad has a reputation of hitting big sixes and here's a sample for you'll. Similar length from Cummins, quite short and Samad was expecting it. Hangs back and deep in his crease, completes a full circle by tonking it over deep square leg</p>
