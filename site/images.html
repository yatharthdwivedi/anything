		"Don't get afraid if what you are thinking is not working out. All humans&nbsp;are&nbsp;afraid to accept the fact that 
		sometime they are gonna have to lose or fail but this is the truth there's always gonna be a low in your life
		which you're gonna have to accept it & you're gonna have to push yourself hard to overcome that low tide . Every succesful person has
		faced the lows in their life but their determination was the thing which kept them moving instead of most of us they didn't give up
		and now they are fulfilling their dreams which they might've saw in their lows too like us"</p>
